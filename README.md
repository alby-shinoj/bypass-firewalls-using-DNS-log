# Bypass Firewalls by DNS History Script

This script is designed to help bypass Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) by leveraging DNS history. It gathers subdomains, checks for potential WAF bypasses, and outputs the results.

## Step-by-Step Explanation:

### Constants and Variables Setup:
- Sets up script paths, colors for output, and input variable parsing.
- Parses command-line arguments for the domain, output file, list of subdomains, and whether to check all subdomains.

### Script Information Display:
- Displays usage information if no domain is provided.

### Dependency Check:
- Checks if `jq` is installed, which is necessary for parsing JSON responses.

### Temporary Files Cleanup:
- Cleans up any previous temporary files related to the domain.

### Subdomain Handling:
- Reads subdomains from the provided list if specified.

### Logo Display:
- Displays a logo for aesthetic purposes.

### Matchmaking Function:
- Compares HTML content to calculate a match percentage and identifies potential WAF bypass.

### IP Validation Functions:
- Includes functions to check if an IP belongs to a known WAF and if it falls within a specific subnet.

### Subdomain Gathering:
- Gathers subdomains using DNSDumpster, CertSpotter, VirusTotal, and the top-level domain function.
- Filters and sorts the gathered subdomains.

### Scanning and Output:
- Scans each subdomain with both HTTP and HTTPS protocols.
- Retrieves IPs from SecurityTrails.
- Compares original and IP-based responses using the matchmaking function.

### Cleanup:
- Removes temporary files and displays a message indicating where the output is saved.

## Final Checks and Enhancements:

### API Rate Limiting:
- Be cautious of API rate limits when making multiple requests to services like VirusTotal and SecurityTrails.

### Error Handling:
- Add error handling to manage API failures or unexpected responses.

### Output Management:
- Ensure the output file is correctly handled and appended without overwriting.

### Subdomain File Path:
- Ensure the `listsubdomains` file path is valid and accessible.

## Final Script Validation:

Before running the script in a live environment, you might want to test it with a known domain and check the following:

- The subdomain gathering works correctly and retrieves expected subdomains.
- The matchmaking function accurately compares and calculates match percentages.
- The IP validation correctly identifies and excludes known WAF IPs.
- The final output is as expected, listing potential bypass methods.




## Additional Suggestions:

### API Keys:
- Make sure you replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key for VirusTotal.

### Permissions:
- Ensure the script has execution permissions: `chmod +x script.sh`.

### Testing:
- Test with a smaller set of known subdomains to ensure functionality.

### Logging:
- Add logging at each major step to track progress and catch issues quickly.
